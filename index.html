Grasping the structure of the whole is more important than reading every word.</td></tr><tr><td>Decide how much time you will spend</td><td>Real-world time is limited. If you know exactly how long you can actually spend on reading, you can plan how much time to devote to each item.</td></tr><tr><td>Have a purpose and a strategy</td><td>You'll enjoy reading more, and remember it better, if you know exactly why you're reading.</td></tr><tr><td>Read actively</td><td>Never rely on the author's structures alone. Move around in the text, following your own goals.</td></tr><tr><td>Read it three times</td><td>First time for overview and discovery. Second time for detail and understanding. Third time for note-taking in your own words.</td></tr><tr><td>Focus on parts with high information content</td><td>Tables of contents, pictures, charts, headings, and other elements contain more information than body text.</td></tr><tr><td>Use PTML (personal text markup language)</td><td>Mark up your reading with your own notes. This helps you learn and also helps you find important passages later.</td></tr><tr><td>Know the author(s) and organizations</td><td>Authors are people with backgrounds and biases. They work in organizations that give them context and depth.</td></tr><tr><td>Know the intellectual context</td><td>Most academic writing is part of an ongoing intellectual conversation, with debates, key figures, and paradigmatic concepts.</td></tr><tr><td>Use your unconscious mind</td><td>Leave time between reading sessions for your mind to process the material.</td></tr><tr><td>Rehearse, and use multiple modes</td><td>Talking, visualizing, or writing about what you've read helps you remember it.</td></tr></table></div><h3 class="text-center">Read the whole ebook by Paul N.
